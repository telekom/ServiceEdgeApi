# ServiceEdgeApi
Sharing a Service Edge API developed by Deutsche Telekom

## Target

Deutsche Telekom wants to publish an Edge API under any license
which makes the interface definition accessible to any cooperating 
partner: 

Part of the definition could also become the implementations of 
servers serving that API. Here you find that code and the licenses
under which it is released.

## Purpose
By using this method, Deutsche Telekom wants to support the new model 
of standardization: instead of firstly designing all elements and 
establish a consensus between all participants in the discussions 
before implementing the corresponding code, now the implementation 
shall become integrated part of the standardization.
